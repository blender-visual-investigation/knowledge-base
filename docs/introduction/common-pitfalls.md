# Common Pitfalls

Avoid these common mistakes when starting with Blender for visual investigation.

## Technical Pitfalls

### Incorrect Scale

One of the most common issues is working with incorrect scales. Real-world measurements are crucial for forensic work.

**Solution**: Always set up your scene with accurate units and verify dimensions.

### Camera Settings

Using default camera settings can lead to unrealistic perspectives.

**Solution**: Match camera focal length and sensor size to your reference data.

### File Management

Poor file organization makes it difficult to track evidence and maintain chain of custody.

**Solution**: Use consistent naming conventions and project structures.

## Workflow Pitfalls

### Skipping Documentation

Not documenting your process makes it hard to reproduce or verify results.

**Solution**: Keep detailed notes of all steps and settings used.

### Ignoring Reference Data

Working without proper reference measurements or photos leads to inaccurate reconstructions.

**Solution**: Always gather and verify reference data before starting reconstruction work.

### Overcomplicating Models

Adding unnecessary detail wastes time and resources.

**Solution**: Model only what's needed for your investigation purpose.
