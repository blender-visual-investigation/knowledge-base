## NotebookLM: Your AI Tutor

I've set up a dedicated NotebookLM notebook fed with this knowledge base content and relevant external sources. Think of it as an AI tutor that understands both Blender and visual investigation workflows.

**Why it helps:**

Blender can feel intimidating. Tutorials help with the basics, but there's so much information out there that it often takes an hour scrolling through videos and forums just to learn one tiny step. With NotebookLM, the learning curve doesn't feel like a wall anymore—you can ask questions and get explanations in plain language, as well as quick step-by-step guides.

**How to use it:**

1. **Open the notebook:** [NotebookLM for BVI](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/fb5da8b0-98c0-4a37-a957-7e45325fe62a)
2. **Ask specific questions:** Instead of vague queries, be precise. For example: *"Give me the essential steps for camera matching in no more than 10 short steps."*
3. **Provide context:** Tell it your skill level and goal upfront so responses match your needs.
4. **Iterate:** If something isn't clear, ask follow-up questions or request simpler explanations.

**What to expect:**

NotebookLM excels at surfacing the essentials—cutting through tutorial detours to give you what you actually need. It can act as a troubleshooter when you run into problems, helping pinpoint issues.

However, just like a human tutor, the information it provides is only half the battle: **doing the work is still up to you**. Occasionally you may need to consult the original videos or documentation when NotebookLM's instructions fall short. This doesn't diminish its value—it's remarkably effective at laying foundations and accelerating the learning process.
