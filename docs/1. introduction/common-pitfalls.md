# Common Pitfalls

Before you begin, there are a final few key points I want to mention. It is my hope that these pointers will help you avoid hurdles I encountered while learning Blender. Since this knowledge base  encourages you to conduct your own research, keeping these points in mind while watching videos or reading articles could be beneficial. Some of these are simply my opinions, but nonetheless I believe they highlight important aspects to consider.

## Intimidating

Blender is highly versatile and packed with features. This can be intimidating when you first open the program. However, remember that, in general, we will only focus on 15% of its capabilities. Our goal is to learn how to navigate Blender and create a decent model based on external data. Though I don't want to dismiss it entirely, we won't be concentrating on aesthetics, so there will be no lighting, texturing, compositing, or rendering involved. As a result, most options, terms, and windows will be unnecessary for our purposes. 

## Keeping up with Blender (or Tech in general)

Blender is in rapid and constant development. This is great, but it also brings "problems": While the user interface has remained largely consistent since the "big" release of version 2.8, many features may have been updated, with different placements and hotkeys. As most tutorials are based on specific Blender versions, you may encounter difficulties locating certain options mentioned. If something doesn't work, make a note of it and feel free to ask for help. 

## Conflicting Information

If you find yourself out in the wild, watching random Blender tutorials, be cautious of people who present information as the only way to do something or insist on strict rules like "never do X, always do Y". Such rigid approaches can hinder your learning progress; I've personally spent weeks untangling misconceptions caused by these statements. I'll dive a bit deeper into this in the next point but the bottom line is that in most cases the answer to how should I do this or that is: "it depends".

Additionally, be aware that there's a significant difference between using Blender for personal projects and within a professional production environment. While I don't want to suggest that non-professionals offer false advice per se, those with professional experience generally have more reliable information, so seek them out if you can.

I've made an effort to provide you with videos from trustworthy sources.

## It depends

With 3D modeling, just like in real life, there are often multiple ways to achieve a certain result. Don't hesitate to experiment with different techniques to find what works best for you or your goal. Often times picking a certain approach will depend on the intended use of your model. For example, there's a significant difference between a model created for VFX/film work (much more detail, doesn't have to work in real-time) and one designed for games (highly optimized, etc.).

One challenge is determining beforehand what it is that you are creating and how it fits into the larger context of 3D. That's why this course includes an in-depth introduction to the world of 3D. By understanding the possibilities and limitations, you'll be better equipped to define the intended use of your work and make informed decisions about your approach.

## Blender: a Swiss Army Knife

You may encounter debates about whether Blender is the industry standard or the best 3D software available. To me, these discussions often seem pointless. While each 3D program has its own unique interface and terminology, the fundamental principles of 3D modeling are consistent across all of them. You can create stunning models and animations in Maya, Cinema 4D, 3DS Max, and other programs, but you'll likely face significant licensing fees.

Remember that Blender is just one part of a broader ecosystem of 3D tools and applications. Think of it as a Swiss Army Knife, highly versatile, but there may be specialized tools better suited for specific tasks. Or put differently: You can cut a loaf of bread with a pocket knife, but a bread knife, specifically made for that purpose, might make the job easier. Blender is an excellent program, but it's not the only option available.

## Learning 3D: A Marathon, Not a Sprint

This one might be very obvious, but since there are many "I learned Blender in X days" videos out there I still want to stress that learning a new skill takes time and effort. There is no magic pill. Mistakes are inevitable, and frustration is part of the process. Don't let it discourage you! The key is to keep practicing and the repetition of creating something is the important part, not the thing that you are creating.
