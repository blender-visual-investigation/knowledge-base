# On Blender

Introduction to Blender and why it's valuable for visual investigation.

## What is Blender?

Blender is a free, open-source 3D creation suite.

### Forensic Applications

Blender's comprehensive toolset makes it particularly valuable for visual investigation work. It excels at crime scene reconstruction, allowing investigators to create accurate 3D models of locations and events. The software is equally effective for accident analysis, enabling precise spatial relationships and trajectory calculations. Beyond reconstruction, Blender supports architectural forensics for building analysis, evidence visualization to present complex findings clearly, timeline animations to demonstrate sequences of events, and spatial analysis to understand relationships between objects and locations. These capabilities make Blender an essential tool for professionals working in investigative and forensic contexts.

## Versions

I've chosen to use the most recent stable version of Blender at the time of writing. This may mean some information in the videos is outdated.

I have my own workflow in Blender and will share some advanced tips throughout the course, focusing on quality-of-life improvements based on my experience (e.g., using Blender Launcher).

Our goal is to create models that offer a good representation of a certain location, a starting point for further development and they should be versatile enough to be applied to various implementations—whether they are embedded on a website, used in VR, explainer videos, or other uses, the models we build will offer this flexibility.

## Shortcuts

Blender is designed with the use of shortcuts in mind. Practically everything has a shortcut for it. Even experienced users discover, after years of use, a hidden shortcuts they weren't aware of. Fortunately, the team at [CGBoost.com](http://cgboost.com/) has created a handy document listing the most useful ones. You can download, print, and reference it when you're searching for a specific key or simply browse through to familiarize yourself with what's available.

## Add-ons & Extensions

Blender has an extensive ecosystem of add-ons (or extensions, as they have been recently dubbed). This offers a wealth of customization options. Whether you're looking to streamline your workflow, add a new feature, or a handle specific task, if you think that there should be an add-on for it, there likely is one. However, not all add-ons are created equal. Some may require additional configuration or troubleshooting, and others may only work with specific Blender versions. Additionally, some add-ons are actively maintained, while others may have been abandoned. 

## Additional Software

Later in the course, I will use additional software to capture satellite data and make it importable into Blender. You are welcome to follow along with that process, but I will also provide the data collected as a downloadable resource, since this course primarily focuses on working with Blender, not the other software. It's important however to recognize that trying to achieve specific results often involves navigating confusing tools. A mindset of experimentation and problem-solving is invaluable in these situations, so if you feel like it you can follow along.

I think the beauty of Blender is that it offers this versatility. You can create data in one program, and work on it further in the other.
