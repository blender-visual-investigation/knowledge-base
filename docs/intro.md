## 🔎 The Blender for Visual Investigation Knowledge Base: A Structured Curriculum

Our free, comprehensive knowledge base is systematically designed to equip investigators, journalists, and researchers with the advanced **3D visualization and analysis capabilities** of Blender. Its content is strategically organized around three foundational pillars to ensure a targeted and efficient learning trajectory:

### 1. **Foundational Skills: Blender for Investigative Modeling**

This module provides a **disciplined, beginner-friendly onboarding** to the Blender environment. Unlike general tutorials focused on creative production (e.g., gaming or film), this instruction is **uniquely scoped** to the requirements of visual investigation. The objective is to efficiently transition users from a **zero-knowledge state** to demonstrating a comfortable command of the software's essential tools for verifiable and accurate 3D modeling.

---

### 2. **Specialized Toolkit & Methodologies**

This pillar curates and details a collection of **Blender tools, add-ons, and technical methodologies** that have been refined and adapted specifically for the investigative context. Each resource is accompanied by a **detailed operational explanation** and a **clear delineation of its applicability** across various use cases (e.g., measurement, geo-location, line-of-sight analysis), thereby maximizing the utility of the software in evidence analysis.

---

### 3. **Applied Analysis: Case-Based Workflow Integration**

Focusing on practical application, this section presents **full, integrated workflows** derived from typical investigative scenarios. It offers **step-by-step guidance** and **in-depth technical analyses** of the combined techniques and tools required. The goal is to provide a complete model, from the initial investigative briefing and evidence ingestion to the generation of a precise, verifiable, and desired visual output.


### Teaching Philosophy

Most Blender courses start directly with modeling, rendering, or project-based workflows.
This course takes a different approach — it begins by **building an understanding of geometry and dimensionality**, so learners grasp what they are actually doing when they manipulate objects in 3D space.

By starting with geometry, students learn to think visually *and* structurally, connecting the abstract world of mathematics to the practical world of digital modeling.

## Module 1

### Phase 1: Geometry and the Nature of Dimensions

* Introduce the concept of **geometry** as the mathematical study of space and form.
* Explain **dimensions** step by step:

  * **0D:** A point — no length, width, or height.
  * **1D:** A line formed by connecting points.
  * **2D:** A plane formed by connecting lines.
  * **3D:** A solid formed by extending a plane into depth.
* Briefly touch on the **fourth dimension** as a conceptual or temporal dimension, preparing learners for animation later on.
* Emphasize how these principles form the **foundation of 3D modeling**.

---

### Phase 2: Translating Geometry into Blender Concepts

Once learners understand the fundamentals of geometry, the context shifts to **Blender** and **3D software terminology**.
Students learn how geometric concepts translate into Blender’s vocabulary:

* **0D point → Vertex**
* **1D line → Edge**
* **2D plane → Face**
* **3D object → Mesh**

This section bridges abstract geometry and practical 3D modeling, ensuring students know *why* things are named and structured the way they are.

---

### Phase 3: Getting to Know Blender

The third phase introduces the **Blender interface and workflow**, again using a first-principles approach.

* Start with a **minimal interface**, removing unnecessary panels and elements to make the environment less intimidating.
* Gradually **reintroduce tools and menus** as their function becomes relevant to the project.
* Constantly **connect each new concept** back to the foundational geometry and terminology (vertices, edges, faces, meshes).

This ensures that learners always understand *what’s happening under the hood*, not just which buttons to press.

---

### Phase 4: Learning Through a Small Project

Students apply what they’ve learned through a **small, focused project** designed to reinforce essential skills for **visual investigation**.
The project will:

* Introduce basic modeling and manipulation tools.
* Emphasize **scale**, **proportion**, and **spatial reasoning**.
* Explore **simple statistical or analytical visualizations**, linking geometry and data.
* Encourage experimentation and observation rather than production of polished assets.

---

## Learning Goals

By the end of this course, students will:

* Understand geometry as the foundation of 3D space.
* Recognize how abstract mathematical concepts translate into Blender’s 3D environment.
* Navigate and customize Blender’s interface confidently.
* Apply first-principles thinking to build, analyze, and visualize 3D structures.
* Approach Blender as a **tool for exploration and understanding**, not just creation.
