# Welcome

Let's discover **Blender for Visual Investigation in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started




## **Course Concept: Blender for Visual Investigation**

### **1. Overview**

This course is a **beginner-friendly introduction to Blender**, designed with a unique focus on **visual investigation** rather than creative production for games, architecture, or film.
Its goal is to help students understand **how 3D space works from first principles**, giving them a solid conceptual foundation before diving into the technical side of Blender.

---

### **2. Teaching Philosophy**

Most Blender courses start directly with modeling, rendering, or project-based workflows.
This course takes a different approach — it begins by **building an understanding of geometry and dimensionality**, so learners grasp what they are actually doing when they manipulate objects in 3D space.

By starting with geometry, students learn to think visually *and* structurally, connecting the abstract world of mathematics to the practical world of digital modeling.

---

### **Module 1**

#### **Phase 1: Geometry and the Nature of Dimensions**

* Introduce the concept of **geometry** as the mathematical study of space and form.
* Explain **dimensions** step by step:

  * **0D:** A point — no length, width, or height.
  * **1D:** A line formed by connecting points.
  * **2D:** A plane formed by connecting lines.
  * **3D:** A solid formed by extending a plane into depth.
* Briefly touch on the **fourth dimension** as a conceptual or temporal dimension, preparing learners for animation later on.
* Emphasize how these principles form the **foundation of 3D modeling**.

---

#### **Phase 2: Translating Geometry into Blender Concepts**

Once learners understand the fundamentals of geometry, the context shifts to **Blender** and **3D software terminology**.
Students learn how geometric concepts translate into Blender’s vocabulary:

* **0D point → Vertex**
* **1D line → Edge**
* **2D plane → Face**
* **3D object → Mesh**

This section bridges abstract geometry and practical 3D modeling, ensuring students know *why* things are named and structured the way they are.

---

#### **Phase 3: Getting to Know Blender**

The third phase introduces the **Blender interface and workflow**, again using a first-principles approach.

* Start with a **minimal interface**, removing unnecessary panels and elements to make the environment less intimidating.
* Gradually **reintroduce tools and menus** as their function becomes relevant to the project.
* Constantly **connect each new concept** back to the foundational geometry and terminology (vertices, edges, faces, meshes).

This ensures that learners always understand *what’s happening under the hood*, not just which buttons to press.

---

#### **Phase 4: Learning Through a Small Project**

Students apply what they’ve learned through a **small, focused project** designed to reinforce essential skills for **visual investigation**.
The project will:

* Introduce basic modeling and manipulation tools.
* Emphasize **scale**, **proportion**, and **spatial reasoning**.
* Explore **simple statistical or analytical visualizations**, linking geometry and data.
* Encourage experimentation and observation rather than production of polished assets.

---

### **4. Learning Goals**

By the end of this course, students will:

* Understand geometry as the foundation of 3D space.
* Recognize how abstract mathematical concepts translate into Blender’s 3D environment.
* Navigate and customize Blender’s interface confidently.
* Apply first-principles thinking to build, analyze, and visualize 3D structures.
* Approach Blender as a **tool for exploration and understanding**, not just creation.

Would you like me to refine this further into a **course outline or syllabus format** (with lesson titles, learning outcomes, and estimated durations)? That would make it ready to present or structure into a curriculum.
