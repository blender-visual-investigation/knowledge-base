# Pivot Points & Object Origin

## Object Origin
Every object has an origin point (the small orange dot). This is the point from which location, rotation, and scale are calculated.

## Pivot Points
The pivot point is the center of any rotation or scaling operation. You can change the pivot point to suit your needs (e.g., 3D Cursor, Individual Origins, Median Point).
