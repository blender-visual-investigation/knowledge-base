## Introduction to the MeasureIt Add-on

The **MeasureIt** add-on is a powerful, built-in Blender tool designed to bring **CAD (Computer-Aided Design) functionality** to the 3D viewport. It allows users to create **dynamic, non-destructive measurements** directly on their 3D models and scenes.

This functionality is essential for any job requiring **exact measurements**, such as:
* **Architectural Projects:** Creating floor plans and blueprints with precise dimensions.
* **Technical Design:** Ensuring components meet specific size and tolerance requirements.
* **3D Printing:** Verifying object dimensions before production.

The measurements, which include distances, angles, arcs, and areas, are dynamic, meaning they **update in real-time** as the mesh or objects are moved.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation

1.  **Enable Add-on:** Go to **Edit** > **Preferences** > **Add-ons** tab. Find **"MeasureIt"** and check the box to enable it.
2.  **Access Panel:** The tool is located in the 3D viewport sidebar (press **N** key) under the **View** tab.
3.  **Display Measurements:** Click the **Show** button in the Measure Tools panel. This must be done every time you open the file to display existing measurements.

### Usage

Most measuring tools require you to be in **Edit Mode** (`Tab` key) with the mesh selected.

| Feature | Setup | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Segment** | Select **two** vertices. | Measures the **length** of a line segment between the two selected points. This measurement is **dynamic** and updates when vertices are moved. |
| **Angle** | Select **three** vertices. | Calculates the **angle** formed by the three selected vertices. |
| **Arc** | Select **three** vertices. | Calculates data for an **arc** defined by the three selected points, including options to draw the full circle. |
| **Area** | Switch to **Face Mode** and select one or more faces. | Calculates and displays the dynamically updated **surface area** of the selected faces. The calculated area is filled with a custom color. |
| **Label** | Select **one** vertex. | Adds a custom **text label** to a specific point without an associated measurement value. |
| **X / Y / Z** | Select **one** vertex. | Creates a measurement from the selected vertex point to the object's **origin** (the orange dot) along the specified axis (X, Y, or Z). |

#### 3. Measurement Creation (Object Mode)

These tools are found when the selection is in **Object Mode**.

| Feature | Setup | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Link** | Select **two** objects, or a vertex on each object. | Measures the **distance** between the two objects. By default, it uses their origins; if vertices are selected, it measures between those specific points. |
| **Origin** | Select one or more objects. | Measures the distance from the **Scene Origin** (where the XYZ axes cross) to the selected object's origin. |
| **Annotation** | Select the button. | Creates a free-floating **text label** (stored as an Empty object) that can be placed anywhere in the scene. |

#### 4. Feature Configuration and Customization

All created measurements appear in the **Items** list and can be individually configured. Global settings are found in the **Configuration** menu.

| Customization Setting | Location | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Labeling** | Item Options | Add custom text to any measurement by typing in the provided box and enabling the **Text** checkbox. |
| **Color Control** | Item Options / Configuration | Change the color of individual measurements (under *Items*) or set a default color for future measurements (under *Configuration*). |
| **Units and Precision** | Configuration | Change the display units (meters, centimeters, feet) and adjust the numerical precision (number of decimal places). |
| **Override All** | Measure Tools | Forces all existing and future measurements to adopt the current settings (color, font, etc.) defined in the **Configuration** menu. |
| **Sum Feature** | Measure Tools | Select a measurement **Group (A-Z)** and then create multiple segments (e.g., around a floor plan). The add-on will dynamically display the **total cumulative length** of all segments in that group. |
| **Scale** | Configuration | **Globally scales up** all measurement values by a set ratio. Useful for modeling small objects that represent massive real-world structures (e.g., a skyscraper). |

#### 5. Mesh Debug and Rendering

* **Mesh Debug Menu:** Displays internal mesh data, useful for developers and complex scene management.
  * **Index:** Shows the position of vertices, edges, or faces in the object's data array.
  * **Location:** Shows the actual real-world XYZ coordinates of selected mesh elements.
  * **Normals:** Displays the direction a polygon is facing, helping identify and fix shading issues.
* **Render Section:** Allows you to **render the scene with the measurement lines and numbers captured**. This is primarily used to create dimensioned **blueprints** or technical drawings directly from the 3D view.

## Summary

MeasureIt turns Blender into a more precise tool for technical work. It bridges the gap between artistic modeling and CAD-like precision visualization.
