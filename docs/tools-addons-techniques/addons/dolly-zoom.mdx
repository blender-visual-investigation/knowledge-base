## Introduction

The **Dolly Zoom add-on** implements the classic cinematic technique in Blender. This function simultaneously alters the camera's position (**dolly**) and its **focal length** (**zoom**). The effect preserves the composition of the scene's subject while manipulating perspective. This capability is instrumental in **manual camera matching**, allowing perspective adjustment without undoing prior positional alignments.

## Installation

The add-on is free and must be manually installed.

**Step-by-step installation:**

1.  **Download:** Obtain the add-on ZIP file from the repository linked in the video description (`https://gitlab.com/VupliDerts/dolly-zoom`).
2.  **Preferences:** In Blender, navigate to **Edit** then **Preferences**.
3.  **Install:** Select the **Add-ons** tab, then click the **Install...** button. Select the downloaded ZIP file.
4.  **Enable:** Locate the installed add-on and ensure the checkbox is marked to enable **"Camera: Dolly Zoom"**.

## Usage

The Dolly Zoom function acts on the **Active Camera**.

**Step-by-step Operation:**

1.  **Select Camera:** Ensure the camera object intended for modification is selected, making it the **Active Camera**.
2.  **Set Pivot:** Place the **3D Cursor** (Shift + Right-click) on the location or object in the 3D scene that must maintain its size and position during the effect. This point acts as the pivot for the dolly zoom.
3.  **Access Tool:**
    * Press **F3** to open the search menu, then search for and select **"Dolly Zoom"**.
    * *Alternative:* Right-click the tool in the F3 menu and select **Add to Quick Favorites**. Access the tool quickly by pressing **Q**.
4.  **Execute and Adjust:** Activate the tool via F3 or Q. Move the mouse to perform the simultaneous camera dolly and focal length change.
    * Hold **Shift** for finer, more controlled adjustments.
5.  **Camera Matching Application:** In the context of aligning a 3D model to a background photograph, use the Dolly Zoom to fine-tune the camera's perspective until objects at varying depths in the 3D scene align with the reference image.

## Summary

The Dolly Zoom add-on facilitates the synchronized manipulation of camera distance and focal length, making it an effective tool for achieving a dramatic cinematic effect. Its primary value in 3D reconstruction is the ability to iteratively adjust the camera's perspective—pivoting around the **3D Cursor**—to achieve precise **manual camera matching** with reference imagery.

## Documentation for Methodology

Understanding how to use the Dolly Zoom tool is only half the work—documenting your perspective adjustments properly is what makes your investigation defensible and reproducible.

<details>
<summary><strong>What to document when using Dolly Zoom</strong></summary>

### In Your Method Section

When describing perspective correction in your methodology, note that the Dolly Zoom add-on was used for iterative camera matching. Specify the pivot point location (3D Cursor position), the reference objects used for alignment verification, and record the final camera parameters: position coordinates and focal length. If Dolly Zoom was used to refine an initial fSpy calibration, document both the starting and ending focal lengths.

### In Your Decision Log

Record the following when using Dolly Zoom:
- Initial camera position and focal length before adjustment
- 3D Cursor placement (what object/feature it was anchored to and why)
- Reference objects used to verify alignment at different depths (near/far)
- Number of adjustment iterations performed
- Final camera position and focal length after correction
- Whether this was a refinement of prior calibration (e.g., fSpy) or standalone matching
- Date performed

### Verification

To verify your Dolly Zoom adjustment is correct, check alignment of objects at multiple depths in the scene. The pivot point object should remain stationary while background and foreground elements shift during adjustment—if the pivot point moves, the 3D Cursor was misplaced. After final adjustment, overlay geometric primitives at near, mid, and far distances; all should align with their corresponding reference image features simultaneously.

### Common Limitations

Dolly Zoom adjusts perspective by changing both position and focal length together—it cannot correct for lens distortion, principal point offset, or rotation errors. If the underlying camera match has fundamental errors (wrong vanishing points, uncorrected distortion), Dolly Zoom will not fix them. The technique requires a clearly identifiable pivot point in the scene; images without distinct foreground objects at known positions are difficult to match. Very wide-angle or telephoto extremes may produce unrealistic results.

### Example Methodology Statement

> "Following initial camera calibration via fSpy, perspective refinement was performed using the Dolly Zoom add-on (Blender 4.2). The 3D Cursor was positioned at [pivot object, e.g., 'the base of the traffic signal post'], which served as the compositional anchor. Iterative adjustment was performed until objects at varying depths—[near reference] and [far reference]—aligned simultaneously with the background photograph. Starting focal length was [X] mm; final corrected focal length was [Y] mm, with camera position shifted [Z] meters along the view axis. Verification was performed by overlaying cube primitives at three depth positions, confirming consistent perspective alignment across the scene."
