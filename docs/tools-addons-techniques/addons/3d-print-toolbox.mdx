## Introduction

The 3D Print Toolbox is a built-in Blender add-on designed for mesh analysis and repair. Its primary function is to check a 3D model against the strict geometric requirements of 3D printing, but its features are highly beneficial for anyone performing visual investigation or precision modeling in Blender.

For visual investigation, the add-on provides instantaneous diagnostics by highlighting specific mesh flaws. This allows an investigator to immediately identify and understand the root cause of a geometric error, such as non-manifold geometry, flipped normals, or faces that intersect themselves. By exposing these hidden issues, the tool facilitates high-fidelity cognitive rebuilding of complex or faulty designs, ensuring that the underlying mesh topology is sound before proceeding with technical analysis or visualization.

## Installation & Usage

### Installation
This addon is included with Blender.

1. Go to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
2. Search for **3D Print Toolbox** or **Mesh: 3D-Print Toolbox**.
3. Enable the checkbox.

### Step-by-Step Guide: Using the 3D Print Toolbox

#### 1. Activation and General Check

1.  **Activate Add-on:** Enable the **3D Print Toolbox** add-on in Blender's Preferences.
2.  **Access Panel:** The toolbox is located in the **N-panel** (Sidebar) under the **3D Print** tab.
3.  **Run Check:** Select the object and click **Check All** in the **Checks** sub-panel. The results will immediately display how many instances of each common mesh problem are present.

#### 2. Key Features and Usage

The add-on divides its functionality into three main areas: **Statistics**, **Transform**, and **Checks**.

| Feature | Sub-Panel | Setup and Use | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Statistics** | Statistics | Select the object and click **Volume** or **Area**. | Calculates and displays the model's **Volume** (useful for material cost) and **Surface Area**. |
| **Scale to Bounds** | Transform | Input a maximum dimension (e.g., 150 mm) and click **Bounds**. | **Rescales** the object so its longest axis (X, Y, or Z) matches the set dimension. Useful for fitting a model to a printer's maximum build size. |
| **Scale to Volume** | Transform | Input a desired volume value (in cm³) and click **Volume**. | **Rescales** the object to match a specific target volume. *Note: Has a technical maximum value limit*. |
| **Non-Manifold Edges** | Checks | Click **Non-Manifold Edges** to select the problematic edges in Edit Mode. | **Identifies holes or open geometry** (edges connected to more or less than two faces). **Fix:** Select the open edge(s) and press **F** to fill a face. |
| **Bad Contig. Edges** | Checks | Click **Bad Contig. Edges** to select areas with flipped normals. | **Identifies faces where normals are flipped** (pointing inward instead of outward). **Fix:** Select all faces and press **Shift + N** to recalculate/flip the normals. |
| **Intersect Face** | Checks | Click **Intersect Face** to select overlapping faces. | **Identifies faces that pass through or overlap each other**. **Fix:** Manually adjust the mesh in Edit Mode to separate the intersecting geometry. |
| **Zero Faces / Zero Edges** | Checks | Click **Zero Faces** or **Zero Edges**. | **Identifies faces or edges with zero or near-zero area/length**. These often result from un-moved extrusions. **Fix:** Select all, press **M** (Merge), and choose **By Distance** to remove overlapping vertices. |
| **Non-Flat Faces** | Checks | Click **Non-Flat Faces** to select non-planar faces. | **Identifies a large face that is not planar** (has an internal bend). **Fix:** **Manually add an edge** across the bend using the **J** key to define the face's plane. *The default detection angle can be adjusted for precision*. |
| **Thin Faces** | Checks | Click **Thin Faces** to select areas below a specified thickness. | **Identifies faces thinner than the set threshold** (thickness). This threshold is configurable based on the specific 3D printer type (e.g., FDM at ~0.86 mm or Resin at ~0.05 mm). **Fix:** Manually thicken the faces. |
| **Sharp Edges** | Checks | Click **Sharp Edges** to select edges with an angle change greater than a threshold (default 160°). | **Identifies corners too sharp to be reliably printed** by the slicing software. **Fix:** Manually move the edge to reduce the angle. |
| **Overhang Face** | Checks | Click **Overhang Face**. | **Identifies faces angled beyond the set threshold** (default 45°) that require support when printing. **Fix:** Rotate or move the geometry to reduce the overhang angle. |

#### 3. Cleanup and Export

* **Cleanup:** The automatic **Cleanup** function performs bulk fixes like checking normals, merging by distance, and applying distortion to make the mesh manifold. It is often recommended to fix issues manually to maintain control over the model geometry.
* **Exporting:** The toolbox provides an **Export** button for direct export, but manual export via **File** > **Export** > **STL** (or other format) is often preferred for more control over export settings.

## Summary

The 3D Print Toolbox is an essential addon for anyone creating physical models from Blender. It automates error checking, provides tools for common print preparation tasks, and streamlines the export workflow. For visual investigation professionals, it ensures that evidence models, scale reconstructions, and forensic exhibits are geometrically sound and ready for accurate physical production.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Analyze meshes for common 3D printing issues
- Automatically fix non-manifold geometry
- Create consistent wall thickness and proper orientation
- Export directly to print-ready formats
