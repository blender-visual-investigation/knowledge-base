# 1.3 : Blender First Steps

Hands-on exercises to build foundational Blender skills.

## Exercise 1: Basic Object Manipulation

### Objective
Practice the fundamental transformation operations.

### Steps

1. **Start fresh**: Delete the default cube (`X` → confirm)
2. **Add a sphere**: `Shift + A` → Mesh → UV Sphere
3. **Move it**: Press `G`, then `Z`, then type `2` → Enter (moves 2 units up)
4. **Rotate it**: Press `R`, then `X`, then type `45` → Enter (rotates 45° around X)
5. **Scale it**: Press `S`, then type `1.5` → Enter (scales to 150%)

## Exercise 2: Creating a Simple Scene

### Objective
Build a basic scene with multiple objects.

### Steps

1. Add a plane: `Shift + A` → Mesh → Plane
2. Scale it: `S` → `10` → Enter (makes it larger)
3. Add a cube: `Shift + A` → Mesh → Cube
4. Move cube up: `G` → `Z` → `1` → Enter
5. Add a light: `Shift + A` → Light → Point
6. Move light: `G` → `Z` → `5` → Enter

## Exercise 3: Camera Setup

### Objective
Learn to position and align the camera.

### Steps

1. Select the camera (click on it in 3D view or Outliner)
2. Press `Numpad 0` to view through the camera
3. Position camera: `G` then move as needed
4. Point at center: Select camera → Add Constraint → Track To → Target: (select your main object)

## Exercise 4: Measurement Practice

### Objective
Work with accurate measurements for forensic work.

### Steps

1. Enable measurements: Edit → Preferences → Interface → Display → Edge Length
2. Tab into Edit Mode
3. Select edges and observe dimensions in the top-left
4. Practice creating objects with specific dimensions

## Tips for Forensic Work

- Always work with real-world units (meters, centimeters)
- Use scene scale settings: Properties → Scene → Units
- Enable measurement overlays
- Document your camera settings
- Save incremental versions of your work

## Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting to save regularly
- Working without reference dimensions
- Not organizing objects in the Outliner
- Ignoring the active object vs selected objects
- Applying transformations in Object Mode vs Edit Mode

## Next Steps

Practice these exercises until they become second nature. Speed and precision come with repetition.
