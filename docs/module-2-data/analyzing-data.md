# Analyzing Data

Best practices for collecting data for 3D reconstruction and visual investigation.

## Types of Data

### Photography

**Essential for:**
- Photogrammetry
- Camera tracking
- Texture mapping
- Documentation

**Requirements:**
- High resolution (12MP minimum, 20MP+ recommended)
- Proper overlap (60-80% between images)
- Consistent lighting when possible
- Include scale references

### Measurements

**Direct measurements:**
- Tape measures for key distances
- Laser rangefinders for larger spaces
- Reference objects of known size

**Why it matters:**
- Validates photogrammetry
- Provides absolute scale
- Confirms reconstruction accuracy

### Video Footage

**Sources:**
- CCTV/surveillance cameras
- Body cameras
- Smartphone recordings
- Dash cameras

**Useful for:**
- Camera tracking
- Timeline reconstruction
- Context and movement

### Existing Documentation

**Sources:**
- Floor plans
- Architectural drawings
- Survey data
- Previous photographs
- Maps

## Photography Best Practices

### Equipment Settings

**Camera settings for photogrammetry:**
- Manual focus
- Fixed focal length (avoid zoom during session)
- Medium aperture (f/8-f/11) for depth of field
- ISO as low as possible
- RAW format when available

### Shooting Patterns

**For object capture:**
- Circle around object at consistent distance
- Multiple heights (low, medium, high)
- Close-ups of details
- 30-50 images minimum

**For scene capture:**
- Grid pattern across area
- Consistent overlap
- Include all boundaries
- 50-200 images depending on size

### Scale References

**Include in photos:**
- Measurement scales/rulers
- Known-size objects
- Photogrammetry targets
- Reference markers

**Placement:**
- Multiple locations
- Visible in many photos
- At different distances from camera
- Don't obscure important evidence

## Measurement Techniques

### Direct Measurement

**Tools:**
- Tape measures
- Folding rulers
- Laser distance meters
- Total stations (professional)

**Record:**
- All measurements with context
- Multiple measurements of critical dimensions
- Environmental conditions
- Date and time

### Reference Objects

**Good reference objects:**
- Standard door height (typically 200cm/80")
- Credit card (85.6mm × 53.98mm)
- US Letter paper (8.5" × 11")
- Standard bricks
- License plates

## Video Capture

### For Camera Tracking

**Requirements:**
- Stable footage (avoid handheld shake)
- Visible static features
- Good lighting
- High resolution (1080p minimum)

**Avoid:**
- Excessive motion blur
- Auto-focus hunting
- Digital stabilization
- Heavy compression

## Metadata Management

### Preserve EXIF Data

**Critical information:**
- Camera make/model
- Focal length
- F-stop
- ISO
- Date/time
- GPS coordinates (if available)

**How to preserve:**
- Don't edit original files
- Copy, don't move files
- Use proper photo management software
- Export metadata to separate file

### Documentation

**Create a log:**
- Date and time of collection
- Weather conditions
- Equipment used
- Personnel present
- Any unusual circumstances

## Chain of Custody

### For Legal Work

**Document:**
- Who collected the data
- When it was collected
- Where it's stored
- Who has accessed it
- Any modifications made

### File Management

**Best practices:**
- Original files remain untouched
- Work on copies
- Version control
- Backup everything
- Hash values for verification

## Field Checklist

Before leaving the scene:

- [ ] Sufficient photo coverage
- [ ] Reference measurements taken
- [ ] Scale markers placed and photographed
- [ ] Metadata verified
- [ ] Equipment settings documented
- [ ] Contact sheets/notes created
- [ ] Backup copy made
- [ ] Chain of custody forms completed

## Common Data Gathering Mistakes

1. **Insufficient overlap** in photos
2. **No scale references** in scene
3. **Inconsistent lighting** between shots
4. **Lost metadata** from files
5. **Poor measurement documentation**
6. **Leaving scene too early** without verification
7. **Not backing up immediately**

## Post-Collection Verification

**Immediately verify:**
- All files transferred successfully
- Images are in focus and properly exposed
- Measurements are legible and complete
- Metadata intact
- Nothing missing or corrupted

**If problems found:**
- Return to scene if possible
- Document what's missing
- Adjust workflow for next time
