# Methodology

Understanding systematic approaches to data collection and analysis for visual investigation.

## The Scientific Method in Visual Investigation

Visual investigation follows a structured methodology to ensure reliable, reproducible results.

### 1. Define the Objective

**Questions to ask:**
- What are you trying to prove or demonstrate?
- What specific questions need to be answered?
- What level of accuracy is required?

**Example**: Determine the line of sight from a specific location at a crime scene.

### 2. Plan the Data Collection

**Consider:**
- What data sources are available?
- What equipment is needed?
- What permissions or access is required?
- What is the timeline?

**Example**: Plan to photograph scene from multiple angles, measure distances, collect camera metadata.

### 3. Gather Evidence Systematically

**Best practices:**
- Follow a consistent pattern
- Document everything
- Take more data than you think you need
- Maintain chain of custody

### 4. Verify Data Quality

**Check for:**
- Completeness
- Accuracy
- Consistency
- Proper metadata

### 5. Process and Analyze

**Steps:**
- Import data into appropriate tools
- Clean and organize
- Apply analysis techniques
- Cross-reference findings

### 6. Document Results

**Include:**
- Methodology used
- Data sources
- Processing steps
- Limitations and assumptions
- Conclusions

## Case Study: Traffic Accident Reconstruction

### Objective
Determine vehicle positions and speeds at time of collision.

### Data Collection Plan
- Scene photographs from multiple angles
- Skid mark measurements
- Vehicle damage documentation
- Road dimensions and slope
- Weather and lighting conditions

### Data Gathering
- 360° panoramic photos
- Reference measurements with scale markers
- Close-up detail shots
- Overhead diagram sketches

### Processing
- Photogrammetry for 3D reconstruction
- Camera matching in Blender
- Distance and angle measurements
- Sight line analysis

### Documentation
- 3D model with measurements
- Rendered views showing key sight lines
- Report with methodology and findings
- Limitations noted (e.g., lighting approximations)

## Key Principles

1. **Reproducibility**: Others should be able to verify your work
2. **Transparency**: Document all steps and assumptions
3. **Accuracy**: Use appropriate precision for the task
4. **Objectivity**: Let the data guide conclusions

## Common Methodological Errors

- Starting reconstruction without clear objectives
- Insufficient data collection
- Poor documentation of process
- Ignoring or hiding contradictory evidence
- Overstating certainty of conclusions
